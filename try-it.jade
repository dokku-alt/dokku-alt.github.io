                | You need to run Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. We recommend you to create a
                | new VPS instance for this. The following bootstrap script
                | will install all necessary components:

            pre.atk-box
                | $ sudo bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/dokku-alt/dokku-alt/master/bootstrap.sh)"

            p
                | After - just follow on-screen instructions.

                | Now you can deploy apps on your Dokku. Let's deploy the
                a(href="https://github.com/heroku/node-js-sample" target="_blank") Heroku Node.js sample app
                |. All you have to do is add a remote to name the app. It's created on-the-fly.



            pre.atk-box
                | $ git clone https://github.com/heroku/node-js-sample
                | $ cd node-js-sample
                | $ git remote add deploy dokku@my.dokku-alt.com:node-js-app
                | $ git push deploy master

                | Right now Buildstep supports buildpacks for Node.js, Ruby, Python,
                a(href="https://github.com/progrium/buildstep#supported-buildpacks" target="_blank") and more
                | . It's not hard to extend the list with your own buildpack. Please check the documentation
                | for your particular build pack as you may need to include configuration files (such as a
                | Dockerfile or Procfile) in your project root.
